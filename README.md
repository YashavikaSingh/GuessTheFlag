The app lets you chose a flag that corresponds to a text prompt. An alert will tell you if you got the answer right or wrong, and what flag you tapped, if you tapped iincorrectly. The game resets after 8 questions are completed. 

The progress view shows the number of questions completed. The number of questions answered correctly is also displayed.
